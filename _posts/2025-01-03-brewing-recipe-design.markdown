    I've been the captain of a brewing design team for the last couple years, and over that time I've learned a bit about homebrewing. Our team focuses on integrating IoT sensors to collect data throughout the brew process and using that data to improve our beers. An important, and difficult, part of home brewing is recipe design. Usually, we'd use our own experiences and sites like [Brewer's Friend](https://www.brewersfriend.com) to design new recipes. After finding a Kaggle dataset of scraped recipe data from Brewer's Friend, I knew I wanted to develop an AI model to guide our development.
