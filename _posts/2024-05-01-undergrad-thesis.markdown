    This project isn't new - I've just included a description of my undergraduate thesis up to it's completion. An ongoing version of this project can be found under "Undergrad Thesis Continuation". Dr. Frostad's lab focuses on studing the physics of thin films. As part of this research, they often need to characterize the structure of composite films from an interferogram - basically a color image of the refraction pattern (think of the rainbow from oil on a puddle). Existing methods for this can be fairly manually intensive as they require annotating a collection of points to generate a descriptive mesh. My thesis focused on developing a way to automate this process.
