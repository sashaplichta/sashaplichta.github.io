    After trans-planting a small amount of *Sedum rupestre*, I noticed that they followed the light throughout the day, something that was exceptionally clear due to the fact that they were a single strands. I was curious about how and why this was happeneing, and wanted to learn more, as well as explore two methods of modelling the reaction: a hard-coded algorithm, and a reinforcement learning model.

    # What's Happening

    # (Hardcoded) Algorithm

    # Reinforcement-Learning Model
